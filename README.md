This project addresses the slow, error-prone manual detection of epileptic seizures from EEGs. It aims to create an automated deep learning tool for faster, more accurate diagnoses. An LSTM model was trained on a preprocessed UCI dataset to learn seizure patterns. The final 92% accurate system is deployed in a web app for real-time predictions.
